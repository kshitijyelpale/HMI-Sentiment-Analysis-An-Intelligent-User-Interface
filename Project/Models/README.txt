Project Title: Sentiment Analysis using LSTM

Importing Dataset: The dataset is divided as
    1. Training Data 80%
    2. Validation and Testing Data 20%
Steps:
1. Download the file "DataSet.7z" and unzip
2. Change the path in importData() method accordingly

saveModel():
1. Change the path in saveModel() method
P.S: Only the path, the file name need not be changed since it will be created automatically

loadModel():
1. Change the path in loadModel() accordingly
Hint: You can just copy paths from saveModel() method and paste!

Run:
1. If you want to save your time, download below files:
    1. "Model_LSTM.json"
    2. "lstm_model_weights.h5"
2. And skip the code from Line# 196 - 205
3. Else, you can execute complete code, you can do so. The model will take much time to train.
